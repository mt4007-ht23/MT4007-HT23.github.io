# Project 

- **Deadline:** {{ $doc.deadline }}
- **Presentation:** {{ $doc.presentation }}

## Overview
For your individual project you will create your own blog post. The post should
illustrate an issue using a unique data set collected by yourself and illustrate
the tools taught in the course. Deadline for handing in the project will be
{{ $doc.deadline }}. Hand-in is done in the usual fashion, where you push it to
your Github repository under a subdirectory called project and raise an issue.
You will be able to push to your Github repository earlier if you want, we will
only assess the version of your code at the time of the deadline. On {{
$doc.presentation }},
you will present your project infront of the class. The presentation should be
no longer than 5 minutes. Presence is compulsory for the entire session you are
presenting in.

**More details of the project will be updated here soon...**
