# Lecture 1
[Lecture Slides]()

## Preperation
Register your github username and so on in the moodle page. If you havent
created a github account make sure to do that and register on the moodle page
immediately so that you can be invited to the github organization. 

**Bring your laptops**. I will aim to make the lecture interactive and bringing
your laptop and following along will make it easier for you to complete the
homework.

Make sure you have read through this page before the lecture. You are not
expected to have done everything but it will be beneficial to have a grasp of what I am planning to go through. 
## Classroom Demo
### Summary
During this lecture demo, I am going to go through the setup of all the necessary tools for the
course. That is, Git, Github, Anaconda and Jupyter. You will not need
anything prior to be installed. We will also go through part
of the first homework.

### Git and Github
#### What is Git and Github ?
Git is a tool used for version control of software projects, it is also very common to use git for easier collaboration on larger projects.
The benefits of using git is extensive and during the course you will hopefully be convinced about using git. 
Github is in essence a cloud-based git repository. However, it is used for much more than just version control. 
Github is a space for developers to share and collaborate on projects. Furthermore, it is space to
showcase ones technical ability to employers as many developers also use Github as
a resume. You can also find various open source
projects that that are free to use. Be very careful
when you use these projects and always make sure that you give proper credit to the original
creator. The template for the course website was cloned from a project on github. You can find
the original creator on the bottom of this page. In most cases being affluent
with github will save you a lot of time. Why rebuild the wheel?

#### How to install Git and Github Desktop 
By installing Github Desktop you get Graphical User Interface(GUI) for git which
automatically connects to your github account. You can install Github desktop by
going to [this link](https://desktop.github.com/). Follow the simple
intructions provided! Once you have downloaded and installed Github desktop, open it up and log
into your Github account. Now you should have git and github desktop installed.

### Anaconda and Jupyter
Anaconda is one of the most popular platforms for scientific computing. It is a
bundle of various software used in data science, packaged succinctly. Jupyter
Lab is one of theses programs inlcuded and it is a popular choice for data scientist used for 
developing and presenting data anaylsis. You will use these tools to do the
homework and present your solutions.

#### How to install Anaconda and Jupyter Lab
To install Anaconda go to the following [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Download and install Anaconda following the instructions.
Once you are done with installing Anaconda we can now go ahead and set up our
environment. To do this you need to work with the command line interface (CLI).
For windows you will have an Anaconda-Bash installed and for MacOS you can use
the terminal tool.

The commands inserted into the command line will be differ based on the
programming language you choose to use.

For python insert and run the following
```powershell
conda config --add channels conda-forge && conda create --name py_env pandas numpy matplotlib jupyterlab -y
```
and for R insert and run the following
```powershell
conda config --add channels conda-forge && conda create --name renv r-essentials r-base=4.1.3 -y
```
Anconda works in environments. The environments are isolated instances of your
programming instances. You can multiple enviroment containing for instance
different packages and versions. You have essentially create an enviroment with
the specific packages that is needed for this course. Typically, one uses
enviroments for different projects so that your programming instance does not
get bloated with unecessary libraries.

After you have installed the necessary environment we can go ahead and open
jupyter lab by first activating the enviroment we have create using the command
```powershell
conda activate ENV_NAME
```
where `ENV_NAME` is `py_env` and `r_env` for python users and r users
respectively.

Finally, run the command
```powershell
jupyter lab
```
And this should open up jupyter lab.

### Tieing it together
Now that you have everything installed its time to create your first notebook
and push it up to your github. This is part of the homework for this week. Check out
[homework 1](/homework/1).
