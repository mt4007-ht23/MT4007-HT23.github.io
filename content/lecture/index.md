# Lectures

The format of the lectures will be a combination of traditional lectures
followed by a live demo of the material taught followed by tutorial session for
the rest of the allotted time. The timeedit schedule can be found [here](https://cloud.timeedit.net/su/web/stud1/s.html?tab=3&object=cevt_48182_HT2023&startDate=20230930&endDate=20240413&type=courseevent&h=t&l=en).

You can find the code for the lecture demos in the following [Github repository](https://github.com/mt4007-ht23/lecture-demos)

The lectures are **not** mandatory, but highly recommended. You will have direct access
to me during the allotted lecture times. Use it!
