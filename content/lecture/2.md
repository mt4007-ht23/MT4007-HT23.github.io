## Git
In the [previous lecture](/lecture/1), we talked about some basic topics of Git
such as commiting, pushing, creating a repository and so on. ( Add some more on
what has been prior). This is sufficient to be able to use Git. However, having an understanding 
of few more core concepts will increase your capabilities and taking your
Git-ting another level. 

### .gitignore
As you might have already seen, when you are developing you will see many
unnecessary files that pop-up, which are a part of the underlying development
program. For instance, if you use jupyter notebooks, a file named `.ipynb_checkpoints` will be generated automatically.
In most cases, tracking the folder with Git is not needed. To ignore, this
particular folder we can use `.gitignore`, which is a file you can create
in the root of your (local) repository, that specifies all the files and folders that you do not want
to track with Git. 

A baCont. Git & Introduction to Dataframes example of a `.gitignore` file, in our case, can be
```python
.gitignore
.ipynb_checkpoints
```
It is typical to also ignore the `.gitignore` file. You can ignore as many file and folders you
deem unnecessary to track.

You can create this file manually, or using Github desktop. Using Github
desktop, in the menu bar, go to `Repository> Repository Settings > Ignored Files`
and add the files and folders you wish to ignore there.

### Forking & Cloning
Forking, is concept that is central to Git. Forking is an action done on a Git
repository, which makes a copy of a repo but that is owned by you. In contrast,
when you clone a repository, you make a copy, but the copy is still linked to
the original process. 

**When should I fork a repository?**
When you want to make changes to a project that you do not have ownership of,
that is, you do not own the git repo, you should fork the repository. Or, if you
want to make your own version of the project and build from the original
project, you should fork the repository. Be mindfull of the rights you have to
the code. If the project is open-source, there is no issue with forking the
code. However, if this is not the case, it is theft of intellectual property. 
When you fork a repository, the project is not linked to the original repo.

**When should i clone a repository??**

When you want to make changes to a repository that that you have ownership of
and you want the changes to be reflected in the original repository.

This course website is a fork of a [Github repository](https://github.com/miracleonyenma/content-v2-blog), the link can also be found in the footer of 
the course webpage. I am also mindfull to give credit to the original creator of
the template.

Cloning is something you have already done, when you set up your repository on
the course organization.

Forking is also very popular when making contributions to open-source
projects. Read more about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

### Branches
In many situations you may want to add a new feature to your code,
for instance, too add a completely new functionality to your program or
to change your entire parts of your code. You typically, don't want to ruin the
original code since you are still in development stages so you might be urgred
to make a copy and develop your new feature on the copied code. Git, defines
this feature as branching. The idea is that you "branch" of from your main
code to develop the feature. If you decide that the feature was a bad idea, you
can just delete the branch and jump to your main branch without changes being
made to your main code. On the other hand, if you decide that the features is
good, you can `merge` the new feature to you main branch. This is an
illustration of how the process of branching may look in a project
![git-branching](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/_images/sub-branch.png)

You may have noticed that you are working on the `main` branch of your
repository. This is the default. You can simply create a new branch whenever you
feel like you want to add a feature to your code that you are unsure about.
